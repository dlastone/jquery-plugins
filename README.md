# jquery-plugins

These are a few jQuery plugins that I wrote a few years back. They were born out of not finding what I needed. 
At the time I didn't find any available plugins that did what I needed for the projects I was working on.


plugins include:
* __jquery-combobox__ - _configurable combobox_
* __jquery-paging__ - _client sided paging_
* __jquery-sessionStatus__ - _shows when a session will timeout_
* __jquery-shadow__ - _add shadow - maybe not so useful when this is now doable in css_
* __jquery-statusMessage__ - _show a centered status_
* __jquery.microToolTip__ - _add a tooltip_
